# Kaprekar_Const
The code in this repository demonstrates how to derive the number '6174' (Kaprekar's constant) from any four-digit number with at least two distinct digits, following Kaprekar's routine.

Example:

Please enter the four digit number by entering each digit.
1 (input 1)

2 (input 2)

3 (input 3)

4 (input 4)


Four digit number entered: 1234

The difference between the descending digits number and the ascending digits number is 4321 - 1234 = 3087


For the next iteration, the unordered four digit number is 3087

The difference between the descending digits number and the ascending digits number is 8730 - 378 = 8352


For the next iteration, the unordered four digit number is 8352

The difference between the descending digits number and the ascending digits number is 8532 - 2358 = 6174


6174 was reached! It took 3 iteration(s).
